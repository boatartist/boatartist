## Hello! Welcome to my github!

I'm Arabella, a high school student passionate about robotics, python and open-source experimentation. I haven't got many projects on here at the moment, but check out my repositories which I'm constantly updating. I'm not a super advanced coder, but I'm commited to documenting my work and making it as simple and effective as possible, so that hopefully I can inspire others to follow along if I get more views, feel free to follow to track my progress. 😜📎❤️

I'm currently working on [my Raspberry Pi-based robot bird phone](https://github.com/boatartist/Robo-spy-pigeon-phone)🪿🤖📱, which is my biggest project yet, so I'd love if anyone checking out the page could let me know, I'm always open for advice, collaboration requests and really any interactions. It's a bit of a mess, but I'm trying to log *everything* I do, so that I can come back and polish it up later into a tutorial so that anyone can copy and improve my design.
